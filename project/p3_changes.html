EKSEMPEL: http://www.idi.ntnu.no/~michailg/IT2805/exampleproject/p3_changesexample.html



The P3_changes.html file should also include:

1. How each of the team members fulfilled their minimum requirements. For example:
Rachel fulfilled her JavaScript requirements with a user-defined function on intro.html and rollovers on
members.html. Tom validated form inputs on orform.html, and implemented the pull-down menu for each page

2. Explicitly state (since it may have changed since the design document), which person worked
on which files, including CSS and JavaScript files, and who produced the artwork (banner and
button design, etc.).

3. Indicate how the modularity requirement was handled (where and how either Server Side
Includes (SSI) or JavaScript were used for modularity, and who was responsible for the
implementation).
